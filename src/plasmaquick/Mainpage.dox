/** @page libplasmaquick libplasmaquick

libplasmaquick is an internal part of lib plasma.

It should not be used directly, however some classes are exposed to Plasma as attached properties.

Namely:
 - AppletInterface
 - ContainmentInterface

which are exposed as "Plasmoid" for applets and containments respectively.

QML applets should import org.kde.plasma.plasmoid 2.0 in order to access this attached object
