 * Plasma::DataContainer wraps the data exported by a DataEngine
 * implementation, providing a generic wrapper for the data.
 *
 * A DataContainer may have zero or more associated pieces of data which
 * are keyed by strings. The data itself is stored as QVariants. This allows
 * easy and flexible retrieval of the information associated with this object
 * without writing DataContainer or DataEngine specific code in visualizations.
