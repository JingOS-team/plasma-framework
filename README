libplasma

This directory contains the classes making up libplasma, which provides the
core framework used by Plasma and its components. This includes applet and
extension definitions and loading, common GUI elements, etc.

Domain specific sets of functionality, e.g. for network awareness or sensors,
are not found here but in one of the Plasma Engines.

Please refer to the Plasma website (http://plasma.kde.org) for API
documentation and design documents regarding this library.
